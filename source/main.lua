    -- We want an environment displayed behind our sprite.
    -- There are generally two ways to do this:
    -- 1) Use setBackgroundDrawingCallback() to draw a background image. (This is what we're doing below.)
    -- 2) Use a tilemap, assign it to a sprite with sprite:setTilemap(tilemap),
    --       and call :setZIndex() with some low number so the background stays behind
    --       your other sprites.

    local backgroundImage = gfx.image.new( "Images/background" )
    assert( backgroundImage )

    gfx.sprite.setBackgroundDrawingCallback(
        function( x, y, width, height )
            -- x,y,width,height is the updated area in sprite-local coordinates
            -- The clip rect is already set to this area, so we don't need to set it ourselves
            backgroundImage:draw( 0, 0 )
        end
    )

end

-- Now we'll call the function above to configure our game.
-- After this runs (it just runs once), nearly everything will be
-- controlled by the OS calling `playdate.update()` 30 times a second.

myGameSetUp()

-- `playdate.update()` is the heart of every Playdate game.
-- This function is called right before every frame is drawn onscreen.
-- Use this function to poll input, run game logic, and move sprites.

function playdate.update()

    -- Poll the d-pad and move our player accordingly.
    -- (There are multiple ways to read the d-pad; this is the simplest.)
    -- Note that it is possible for more than one of these directions
    -- to be pressed at once, if the user is pressing diagonally.

    if playdate.buttonIsPressed( playdate.kButtonRight ) then
        playerSprite:moveBy( 2, 0 )
    end
    if playdate.buttonIsPressed( playdate.kButtonDown ) then
        playerSprite:moveBy( 0, 2 )
    end
    if playdate.buttonIsPressed( playdate.kButtonLeft ) then
        playerSprite:moveBy( -2, 0 )
    end

    -- Call the functions below in playdate.update() to draw sprites and keep
    -- timers updated. (We aren't using timers in this example, but in most
    -- average-complexity games, you will.)
